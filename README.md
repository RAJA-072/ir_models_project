   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/RAJA-072/ir_models_project.git
   cd ir_models_project
   ```

2. **Install Python (if not already installed):**
   - Recommended: Python 3.8 or higher

3. **Run the main script:**
   ```powershell
   python ir_models.py
   ```
   - This will process the documents in the `corpus/` folder and generate `results.csv`.
